# Repository Development and Release Instructions

## Overview

This repository follows a structured workflow based on two primary branches:

- `develop` → ongoing development
- `main` → stable, released versions

All work must follow the branching, versioning, and changelog rules defined below.

---

## Branching Strategy

### Default Behavior

Unless explicitly instructed otherwise:

- All development work MUST start from `develop`
- All new work MUST be done in a feature branch
- Feature work MUST target `develop`
- Release preparation MUST target `main`

---

## Feature Development Workflow

### Branch Creation

- Always create feature branches from `develop`
- Naming convention:
  - `feature/<short-description>`

Examples:
- `feature/conversation-metadata`
- `feature/improve-chat-history`

---

### Feature Pull Requests

- Source branch: `feature/*`
- Target branch: `develop`
- Never target `main` from a feature branch

---

### Expected Flow

1. Start from `develop`
2. Create `feature/<name>`
3. Implement changes
4. Commit changes
5. Open pull request to `develop`

---

## Release Workflow

### Release Branch Creation

- Release branches MUST be created from `develop`
- Naming convention:
  - `release/x.y.z` (no `v` prefix)

Examples:
- `release/1.2.3`
- `release/2.4.2`

---

### Release Responsibilities

When preparing a release branch:

- Update version references where applicable
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`
- Ensure the repository reflects a releasable state
- Do NOT introduce new feature work
- **GitHub Release titles MUST be exactly the tag name** (for example,
  `v2.8.0`). Never prefix release titles with the product or service name (for
  example, do not use `GPT-RAG v2.8.0`, `GPT-RAG Orchestrator v2.8.0`, or
  `gpt-rag-ui v2.8.0`).
- **MANDATORY for EVERY GPT-RAG umbrella release — no exceptions.** The
  published GitHub Release notes (the `gh release create` / `gh release edit`
  body, NOT just the `CHANGELOG.md`) MUST include a `## Component versions`
  section with a Markdown table listing every validated runtime component
  from `manifest.json` `components[]` plus `infra / AI Landing Zone` from
  `manifest.json` `ailz_tag`. This is required even for a patch release where
  only the landing-zone pin changed and the runtime component versions are
  unchanged — always restate the full validated combination so operators see
  the exact set without cross-referencing other releases.
- Read the versions directly from `manifest.json` at release time (`tag` for
  each entry in `components[]`, and `ailz_tag` for the landing zone). Do not
  hand-copy from a previous release.
- Place the `## Component versions` table immediately after the `## Changed`
  section and before `## Validation`, matching the existing published
  releases (e.g. `v2.8.0`, `v2.8.1`).
- The same table is ALSO added to `CHANGELOG.md` under the release heading
  (as the `### Validation` component table). The GitHub Release notes and the
  changelog must agree.

Required GitHub Release notes skeleton:

```md
## Changed
- <what changed in this release>

## Component versions

| Component | Version |
| --- | --- |
| gpt-rag-ui | vX.Y.Z |
| gpt-rag-orchestrator | vX.Y.Z |
| gpt-rag-ingestion | vX.Y.Z |
| infra / AI Landing Zone | vX.Y.Z |

## Validation
- <commands / Azure env used to validate>
```

- **MANDATORY — never leak personal Azure environment or resource group names
  in published GitHub Release notes.** The `## Validation` section (and any
  other prose) MUST NOT contain the maintainer's `azd` environment names
  (`gptrag-MMDDYYHHMM`, e.g. `gptrag-0601261130`) or resource group names
  (`rg-gptrag-MMDDYYHHMM`). These are private, throwaway validation
  environments and are noise to operators. Use generic phrasing instead:
  "a validation environment", "a fresh Basic deployment", or "the validation
  resource group". Region names (`swedencentral`, `francecentral`) and
  feature flags (`NETWORK_ISOLATION=false`, `BUILD_MODE=acr-task`) are fine to
  keep — only the `gptrag-*` / `rg-gptrag-*` tokens must be stripped. Before
  publishing or editing any release, grep the body for `gptrag-\d{10}` and
  remove every match.

- **Preserve markdown formatting when editing release notes via the API.**
  `gh release view <tag> --json body -q .body` returns the body as a
  PowerShell **array of lines**; passing that array straight into
  `[regex]::Replace` coerces it to a single string joined with spaces and
  **flattens the whole release** (headings, bullets, and table rows collapse
  into one paragraph). Always rejoin the array on newlines first (e.g.
  `[string]::Join([char]10, $arr)`), edit with `Get-Content -Raw`, write back
  with `Set-Content -NoNewline`, and republish with `gh release edit <tag> --notes-file <file>`. After editing, re-fetch and
  confirm the body still has the expected line count and that `## ` headings
  start at the beginning of a line.

---

### Release Pull Requests

- Source branch: `release/x.y.z`
- Target branch: `main`

---

### Expected Flow

1. Start from `develop`
2. Create `release/x.y.z`
3. Update version and changelog
4. Open pull request to `main`

---

## Versioning Rules

- Follow semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Version numbers MUST use the `v` prefix in:
  - tags
  - changelog entries

Examples:
- `v1.2.3`
- `v2.4.2`

---

### Important Distinction

- Branch name:
  - `release/1.2.3`
- Tag and changelog:
  - `v1.2.3`

---

### Version Increment Guidelines

- PATCH → bug fixes and minor improvements
- MINOR → backward-compatible features
- MAJOR → breaking changes

---

## Changelog Rules

### Format

- Follow **Keep a Changelog**
- Follow **Semantic Versioning**
- Every release MUST update `CHANGELOG.md`

### IMPORTANT: No `[Unreleased]` Section on `main`

- The `main` branch MUST NEVER contain an `[Unreleased]` section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- When creating a release branch, the `[Unreleased]` header MUST be replaced with the versioned header `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
- The `develop` branch MAY use `[Unreleased]` as a staging area for upcoming changes, but it MUST be converted before merging into `main`.

---

### Version Header Format

```md
## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
```

---

## Documentation Consistency (Mandatory)

Documentation must always reflect the **current, shipped** implementation.
Whenever a change in this repository (or in a runtime component it pins via
`manifest.json`) has a user-visible effect — a new or renamed feature, a new
App Configuration key, a new/changed deployment parameter or default, a
changed deploy flow, a new component version, or a breaking change — the
matching documentation MUST be updated **in the same change set**, not
deferred.

- **User-facing docs live in the `gpt-rag-docs` repo** (the `docs` branch of
  `Azure/gpt-rag`), published with MkDocs Material to
  https://azure.github.io/GPT-RAG/. Update the relevant page there on the
  `docs` branch (or a feature branch off it). Register new pages under `nav:`
  in `mkdocs.yml`.
- **Do not duplicate** product docs into this repo or into service-repo
  READMEs — keep READMEs short and link to the published site instead.
- **If unsure whether a doc page is affected, check**: search the docs source
  for the feature / config-key / parameter name you changed and update every
  page that references it.
- A change with a user-visible effect is **not complete** until its docs are
  updated or you have confirmed no page is affected. Treat drift between the
  published site and the implementation as a bug.
