# GPT-RAG release

Follow `AGENTS.md`, the complete release rules in
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and the `multi-repo-release` skill.

Read all component and AI Landing Zone versions directly from `manifest.json`.
Validate that the pinned combination is compatible and that the changelog and
GitHub Release notes describe the same combination. Preserve the required
branch targets, tag format, release title, component table, validation
evidence, and documentation updates.

Never expose personal Azure environment or resource group names. Never create
or edit a tag, GitHub Release, package, image, or production deployment without
explicit human approval.

Output handoff: proposed version, validated pins, release artifacts changed,
validation evidence, documentation status, rollback path, and remaining
approval actions.
