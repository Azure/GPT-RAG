# GPT-RAG implementation

Follow `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and all scoped
instructions that apply to the changed files.

Investigate the current implementation and tests, make the smallest coherent
change, and preserve contracts and deployment behavior by default. Reuse
existing modules, templates, scripts, and configuration paths.

Before editing, confirm acceptance criteria, affected repositories, security
and compatibility risks, and documentation impact. Add or adjust behavioral
tests, update affected documentation in the correct repository or branch, and
run the existing validation specific to the change.

Input handoff: an issue, plan, or ADR with high-impact decisions resolved.

Output handoff: delivered behavior, changed files, commands and results,
cross-repository dependencies, documentation status, and residual risks.
