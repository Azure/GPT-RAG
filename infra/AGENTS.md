# AI Landing Zone engineering-agent contract

This is the stable repository-wide contract for GitHub Copilot engineering
agents. Detailed procedures belong in `.github/skills/`; file-specific rules
belong in `.github/instructions/`.

The assets under `.github/agents/` and `.github/skills/` guide engineers who
develop and operate this repository. They do not define Microsoft Foundry
agents, Container Apps, MCP servers, or any other deployed Azure resource.

## Priority

Follow, in this order:

1. Security, privacy, authorization, and platform instructions.
2. Task requirements and acceptance criteria.
3. Executable Bicep, parameter, manifest, and pipeline contracts.
4. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, this contract, and applicable scoped
   instructions.
5. Local conventions observed in the affected files.

Do not guess when missing information could affect identity, networking,
compatibility, releases, or production. Record the uncertainty and obtain a
human decision.

## Repository purpose and boundaries

This repository is a reusable Azure AI Landing Zone implemented in Bicep. It
provides secure, parameterized infrastructure for Microsoft Foundry and related
Azure services in standard and network-isolated deployment modes.

- `main.bicep` is the resource-group-scoped orchestrator. It composes AVM and
  local modules under feature-flag conditions.
- `main.parameters.json` is the azd parameter and environment-substitution
  surface.
- `modules/` contains reusable resource logic:
  - `ai-foundry/`: Foundry account, project, connections, and nested resources.
  - `networking/`: VNets, subnets, NSGs, private DNS, private endpoints,
    public ingress, Bastion, and Azure Firewall.
  - `security/`: control-plane and Cosmos DB data-plane role assignments.
  - `container-apps/`: app-list shaping and runtime configuration values.
  - `app-configuration/`: App Configuration key-value population.
  - `bing-search/`: Grounding with Bing resources.
- `constants/` is the source for role IDs and resource abbreviations.
- `scripts/` and `install.ps1` contain cross-platform PowerShell automation.
- `pipelines/azuredevops/` and `.github/workflows/` contain validation and
  deployment automation.
- `tests/` contains deterministic preflight tests and the optional hub/spoke
  integration fixture.
- `manifest.json` is a release and jumpbox-bootstrap contract. Consumers may
  extend its pinned `components` list.

Keep `main.bicep` as the orchestrator. Add reusable resource bodies to focused
modules rather than duplicating them inline. Drive deployment shape from
`containerAppsList`, `modelDeploymentList`, `databaseContainersList`,
`storageAccountContainersList`, and related data structures instead of
workload-specific branches.

## Compatibility and parameterization

- Preserve feature-flag gating and the distinction between standard and Zero
  Trust/network-isolated deployments.
- Preserve nullable fallback behavior for substituted values. A value that azd
  can replace with an empty string must have a safe Bicep fallback before it
  reaches a resource property.
- Add capabilities in this order: described Bicep parameter, matching parameter
  file value, empty-substitution fallback when needed, module/resource wiring,
  App Configuration publication when runtime consumers need it, and an output
  when downstream automation needs it.
- Treat parameter names, defaults, allowed values, output names, manifest
  fields, App Configuration keys, and module interfaces as compatibility
  contracts. Prefer additive changes and document migration for breaking ones.
- Preserve `app.target_port` for ingress and Dapr, with `8080` as the fallback.
- Preserve compatibility for consumers that mount this repository at `infra/`
  and overlay `main.parameters.json` and `manifest.json`.

## Identity, networking, and naming

- Prefer managed identity and least-privilege RBAC. Keep role assignments
  explicit and centralized through `modules/security/`.
- Read role IDs and abbreviations from `constants/`; do not duplicate literals.
- Never hardcode tenant IDs, subscription IDs, credentials, or environment-
  specific resource names.
- Preserve both CAF and legacy naming modes. Explicit resource-name parameters
  override generated names in both modes.
- Treat private DNS, private endpoint ordering, subnet delegation and sizing,
  hub/spoke peering, route tables, and public-network-access decisions as
  security-sensitive contracts.
- Keep private endpoint creation and dependencies serialized where the existing
  topology requires it.

## PowerShell and deployment automation

- PowerShell 7 is the shared script runtime on Windows and POSIX azd hooks.
- Quote external input, avoid logging secrets, fail explicitly on unmet
  prerequisites, and preserve idempotency.
- `install.ps1` runs under the Windows Custom Script Extension's fixed timeout.
  Preserve its wall-clock budgets, fatal/optional step distinction, and bounded
  network operations.
- Azure DevOps deploy steps use Bash inside pipeline YAML. When shared behavior
  changes, keep pipeline and PowerShell semantics aligned where applicable.
- What-If or `azd provision --preview` is evidence, not authorization to deploy.
  Never provision, tag, release, or modify production without explicit approval.

## Validation and evidence

Run the narrowest existing validation that covers the change, then broaden with
risk:

- Copilot assets:
  `pwsh ./.github/scripts/Validate-CopilotAssets.ps1`
- Validator tests:
  `pwsh ./tests/scripts/Validate-CopilotAssets.Tests.ps1`
- Bicep compile/lint:
  `az bicep build --file main.bicep` and
  `az bicep lint --file main.bicep`
- Compiled-template size:
  `pwsh ./scripts/Measure-MainJsonSize.ps1`
- Deterministic preflight tests:
  `pwsh ./tests/scripts/Invoke-PreflightChecks.Tests.ps1`
- Azure-aware preflight:
  `pwsh ./scripts/Invoke-PreflightChecks.ps1`
- Deployment preview:
  `azd provision --preview`
- End-to-end validation:
  `azd provision` in an approved test environment.

Do not invent validation commands or claim Azure behavior from compilation
alone. Report commands, results, skipped validation, and residual risk.

## Architecture, documentation, and releases

Load `engineering-principles` for design, meaningful refactoring, Azure
integration, security, testing, or operational changes. Load
`architecture-decision` for hard-to-reverse changes to boundaries, contracts,
identity, topology, or deployment behavior.

Use `documentation-consistency` whenever behavior, parameters, defaults,
outputs, deployment modes, or operator steps change. Keep `README.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, relevant `docs/` runbooks, and the public
`Azure/AI-Landing-Zones` documentation aligned with shipped behavior.

This repository uses semantic versioning. `main` holds released versions and
`develop` is the integration branch when present. Before feature work, ensure
the integration branch includes the latest release from `main`. Release tags
and GitHub Release titles use exactly `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`; keep
`manifest.json`, changelog, tag, and release title aligned. Major or minor
changes require Portal and Terraform landing-zone parity review.

## Collaboration and handoffs

- Agents deliver decisions, changed contracts, evidence, documentation status,
  rollback guidance, and residual risks rather than activity summaries.
- Architecture hands implementation explicit boundaries, trade-offs, fitness
  functions, migration constraints, and open questions.
- Implementation hands validation the changed behavior, affected files,
  expected compatibility, and required evidence.
- Validation hands release reproducible commands and results, not assumptions.
- Release and production operations require explicit human approval.
