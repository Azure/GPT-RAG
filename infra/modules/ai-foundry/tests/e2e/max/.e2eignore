Ignoring this test due to issues in the order of operations when removing resources that include networkInjections on the Cognitive Services Account. The Account resource locks the "agents" subnet and the link is not able to be removed. Workarounds are available but are not reliable in the automated testing process. See the "removeLockingDependencyAfterDeployment" parameter on this test and the associated "/tests/shared/removeLockingDependencies.bicep" module as a sample workaround.
