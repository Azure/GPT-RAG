"""Cross-repo drift guard: the exact App Configuration keys the merged
``gpt-rag-ingestion`` operator-facing panel surfaces (PR #274, merge
``5569dd6af3ecb317e1037108cb21859f1b2185a1``) and the merged ``gpt-rag-ui``
user-facing panel surfaces (PR #99, merge
``ee3b53b29019e675c1e9ff19ee607cea361e5a8e``) actually consume.

This umbrella repository does not vendor either component's source, so this
fixture is an explicit, reviewed snapshot of every ``config.get(...)``/
``environ.get(...)`` key name each consumer reads, captured directly from
those two merge commits (see the docstring of each key group below for the
exact source reference). If either consumer adds, renames, or removes a
config key, this test (and the umbrella's own ``config.panel.settings``)
must be updated together -- silent drift between the umbrella's published
defaults and what a consumer actually reads is exactly the failure mode this
guards against.

Keys intentionally excluded here because they are *not* panel-specific and
are already published unconditionally by other mechanisms (never duplicated
by ``config.panel.settings``):

- ``DEPLOY_ADMINISTRATIVE_PANEL`` -- published by
  ``config.deployment.composition.compose_parameters`` directly (reflects
  resolved topology; see ``tests/test_deployment_modes.py``).
- ``DATABASE_ACCOUNT_NAME`` / ``DATABASE_NAME`` / ``STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`` --
  published unconditionally by the AI Landing Zone submodule for every
  topology (``infra/main.bicep``), regardless of the panel.
- ``DATA_INGEST_APP_APIKEY`` -- the reserved per-app ``<APP>_APIKEY`` Key
  Vault reference the AI Landing Zone submodule publishes automatically for
  every ``containerAppsList`` entry; republishing it here would create a
  duplicate key-value and fail deployment (see ``infra/main.bicep``'s
  ``additionalAppConfigurationSettings`` description).
- ``JOBS_LOG_CONTAINER`` -- ingestion's existing per-file-log blob control
  store container name (defaults to ``"jobs"`` in ``tools/admin.py`` /
  ``tools/corpus_curation_store.py`` even when unset); reused verbatim by
  corpus curation, never a new blob container or secret.
- ``OAUTH_AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID`` / ``OAUTH_AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID`` -- ingestion's
  existing admin-dashboard bearer/audience configuration, reused as-is by
  ``validate_delegated_operator_bearer`` (no new auth config key).
