"""Public hosted-panel settings shared by deployment publishers.

Mirrors ``config.continuity.settings``: every key here is safe to publish
unconditionally (App Configuration label ``gpt-rag``) because it is inert
unless ``DEPLOY_ADMINISTRATIVE_PANEL`` and ``PANEL_HISTORY_ENABLED`` are both
``true`` (see ADR-0004 and the merged ``gpt-rag-ui`` ``panel_config.py``,
which this module's key names and defaults match exactly -- no duplicate or
invented keys).

``PANEL_HISTORY_OWNER_BINDING_VALIDATED`` is forced to ``false`` here the
same way ``HOSTED_CONVERSATION_OWNER_BINDING_VALIDATED`` is forced to
``false`` in ``config.continuity.settings``: it is this ADR's own
environment-evidence gate for the panel's list/read call path, and no live
verification procedure for that gate ships in this change (only the
platform contract -- containers, RBAC, App Configuration keys, and the
versioned schema). Flipping it to ``true`` is out of scope until a
dedicated verification procedure exists; until then the panel safely stays
on its ``owner_index`` pre-gate/fallback mechanism, which is fully
functional and never itself returns an error for the unmet gate.

``PANEL_OPERATOR_SURFACES_ENABLED``, ``PANEL_OPERATOR_APP_ROLE``, and
``PANEL_OPERATOR_GROUP_ID`` mirror the exact key names and safe defaults the
merged ``gpt-rag-ingestion`` operator-facing overview/corpus-curation
surfaces consume (PR #274, merge ``5569dd6af3ecb317e1037108cb21859f1b2185a1``
-- see ``api/panel_operator.py``'s ``_require_gate_enabled`` and
``dependencies.operator_role_or_group_configured``/
``_operator_role_or_group_config``): those endpoints fail closed (503)
unless ``DEPLOY_ADMINISTRATIVE_PANEL=true``,
``PANEL_OPERATOR_SURFACES_ENABLED=true``, and an explicit operator app role
or group is configured. ``PANEL_OPERATOR_SURFACES_ENABLED`` is forced to
``false`` here the same way ``PANEL_HISTORY_OWNER_BINDING_VALIDATED`` is:
no dedicated evidence-gate verification procedure for the operator surfaces
ships in this change, so the safe default stays force-published regardless
of what an operator may set locally, even though the ingestion component
work itself has landed. ``PANEL_OPERATOR_APP_ROLE``/``PANEL_OPERATOR_GROUP_ID``
are plain operator inputs (like ``PANEL_CONVERSATIONS_TOKEN_AUDIENCE``/
``PANEL_CONVERSATIONS_TENANT_ID`` above) -- published empty and safely
overridable once an operator is ready to name a real app role or group.
``PANEL_CURSOR_TTL_SECONDS`` and ``PANEL_OVERVIEW_MIN_CARDINALITY`` (below)
are shared verbatim with ingestion's own cursor/suppression defaults --
no separate ingestion-only copy is published.
