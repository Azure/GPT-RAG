"""Capability profile catalog (FR-015e, R12).

This fixed table is the only source of role assignments for application
identities. Application definitions name profiles, never roles. Role names
match the ``roles`` vocabulary of ``containerAppsList`` in
``main.parameters.json`` so the bundled trio keeps its current permissions.

Feature-owned assignments (continuity, administrative panel, hosted-agent
access) stay in their own modules and are intentionally not modeled here.
