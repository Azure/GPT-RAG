The **RAG pattern** enables businesses to use the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, using their existing models to process and generate responses based on new data. RAG facilitates periodic data updates without the need for fine-tuning, thereby streamlining the integration of LLMs into businesses. 

The **Enterprise RAG** Solution Accelerator (GPT-RAG) offers a robust architecture tailored for enterprise-grade deployment of the RAG pattern. It ensures grounded responses and is built on Zero-trust security and Responsible AI, ensuring availability, scalability, and auditability. Ideal for organizations transitioning from exploration and PoC stages to full-scale production and MVPs.

## Getting Started

To deploy Enterprise RAG and get your solution up and running, you will use **azd**, **Python**, **Git**, **Node.js 16+**, and **PowerShell 7** (only if you are using Windows).

Pre-reqs links:
 - Azure Developer CLI: [Download azd for Windows](https://azdrelease.azureedge.net/azd/standalone/release/1.5.0/azd-windows-amd64.msi), [Other OS's](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).
 - Powershell (Windows only): [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4#installing-the-msi-package)
 - Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 - Node.js 16+ [windows/mac](https://nodejs.dev/en/download/)  [linux/wsl](https://nodejs.dev/en/download/package-manager/)
 - Python 3.10: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/)

### Basic Installation

After installing the pre-requirements you just need to execute the next four steps using [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install) in a terminal:

**1** Download the Repository:

```sh
azd init -t azure/gpt-rag
```

**2** Login to Azure:

```sh
azd auth login

```

**3** Start Building the infrastructure and components deployment:

```sh
azd up
```

**4** Add source documents to object storage

Upload your documents to the documents folder in the storage account which name starts with strag (Default storage account as shown in the sample image)

### Zero trust installation

To deploy the zero trust implementation, follow the same steps, but with the following additional steps.  
   
**1** Before executing the ```azd up``` command, make sure to run the following line:  
   
```sh  
azd env set AZURE_NETWORK_ISOLATION true  
```  
 
**2** Download the Repository:

```sh
azd init -t azure/gpt-rag
```

**3** Login to Azure:

```sh
azd auth login

```

**4** Start Building the infrastructure and components deployment:

```sh
azd up
```
  
After the infrastructure is provisioned and before starting the deployment of the components, you will be asked the following question:  
   
> Zero Trust Infrastructure enabled. Confirm you are using a connection where resources are reachable (like VM+Bastion)? [Y/n]:  
   
Initially, you will not be connected to the same vnet where the resources can be accessed, so answer `n`.

**5** Next, you will use the Virtual Machine with the Bastion connection (created during step 4) to continue the deployment.  
   
Log into the created VM with the user **gptrag** and authenticate with the password stored in the keyvault, similar to the figure below:  

<BR>

**6**  Upon accessing Windows, install [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4#installing-the-msi-package), as the other prerequisites are already installed on the VM.  
   
**7** Open the command prompt and run the following command to update azd to the latest version:  
   
```  
choco upgrade azd  
```  
   
After updating azd, simply close and reopen the terminal.  
   
**8** Create a new directory, for example, `gptrag` then enter the created directory.  
   
```  
mkdir gptrag  
cd gptrag  
```  
To finalize the procedure, execute the subsequent commands in the command prompt to successfully complete the deployment:

```  
azd init -t azure/gpt-rag  
azd auth login   
azd env refresh  
azd package  
azd deploy  
```  
   
> Note: when running the ```azd init ...``` and ```azd env refresh```, use the same environment name, subscription, and region used in the initial provisioning of the infrastructure.  
   
Done! Zero trust deployment is completed.
