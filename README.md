The **RAG pattern** enables businesses to use the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, using their existing models to process and generate responses based on new data. RAG facilitates periodic data updates without the need for fine-tuning, thereby streamlining the integration of LLMs into businesses. 

The **Enterprise RAG** Solution Accelerator (GPT-RAG) offers a robust architecture tailored for enterprise-grade deployment of the RAG pattern. It ensures grounded responses and is built on Zero-trust security and Responsible AI, ensuring availability, scalability, and auditability. Ideal for organizations transitioning from exploration and PoC stages to full-scale production and MVPs.

✨ See our [User & Admin Guide](docs/GUIDE.md) for complete setup and usage details.

## Application Components

GPT-RAG follows a modular approach, consisting of three components, each with a specific function.

* **[Data Ingestion](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-ingestion)** - Optimizes data chunking and indexing for the RAG retrieval step.

* **Orchestrator** - Coordinates the flow to retrieve information and generate a user response. It offers two options: **[Functional](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-orchestrator)**, using Semantic Kernel functions (default), and **[Agentic](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-agentic)**, using AutoGen agents. See deployment instructions to switch to Agentic.

* **[App Front-End](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-frontend)** - Uses the [Backend for Front-End](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/backends-for-frontends) pattern to provide a scalable and efficient web interface.

<!-- * [Teams-BOT](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-bot) Constructed using Azure BOT Services, this platform enables users to engage with the Orchestrator seamlessly through the Microsoft Teams interface. -->

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the deployment process of Enterprise RAG. There are two deployment options available, **Basic Architecture** and **Zero Trust Architecture**. Before beginning the deployment, please ensure you have prepared all the necessary tools and services as outlined in the **Pre-requisites** section.

**Pre-requisites**

 - Initiate an [Azure AI services creation](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne) and agree to the Responsible AI terms **

** If you have not created an Azure AI service resource in the subscription before

### Basic Architecture Deployment

For quick demonstrations or proof-of-concept projects without network isolation requirements, you can deploy the accelerator using its basic architecture.
![Basic Architecture](media/architecture-GPT-RAG-Basic.png)

The deployment procedure is quite simple, just install the prerequisites mentioned above and follow these four steps using [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install) in a terminal:


**1** Download the Repository:

```sh
azd init -t azure/gpt-rag
```

> **Note**: Add `-b agentic` if using the Agentic AutoGen-based orchestrator.
> ```sh
> azd init -t azure/gpt-rag -b agentic
> ```

**2** Login to Azure:

**2.a** Azure Developer CLI:

```sh
azd auth login
```

**2.b** Azure CLI:

```sh
az login
```

**3** Start Building the infrastructure and components deployment:

```sh
azd up
```

**4** Add source documents to object storage

Upload your documents to the 'documents' folder located in the storage account. The name of this account should start with 'strag'. This is the default storage account, as shown in the sample image below.

 ![storage_sample](media/readme-storage_sample.png)

**Done! Basic deployment is completed.**

**Recommended**: [Add app authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service). [Watch this quick tutorial](https://youtu.be/sA-an25jMB4) for step-by-step guidance.


### Zero Trust Architecture Deployment

For more secure and isolated deployments, you can opt for the Zero Trust architecture. This architecture is ideal for production environments where network isolation and stringent security measures are highly valued.

 ![Zero Trust Architecture](media/architecture-GPT-RAG-ZeroTrust-LZ.png)

Before deploying the Zero Trust architecture, make sure to review the prerequisites. It's important to note that you will only need Node.js and Python for the second part of the process, which will be carried out on the VM created during the deployment of this architecture.

The deployment procedure is similar to that of the Basic Architecture, but with some additional steps. For a detailed guide on deploying this option, refer to the instructions below:

**1** Download the Repository

```sh
azd init -t azure/gpt-rag
```

> **Note**: Add `-b agentic` if using the Agentic AutoGen-based orchestrator.
> ```sh
> azd init -t azure/gpt-rag -b agentic
> ```

**2** Enable network isolation
   
```sh  
azd env set AZURE_NETWORK_ISOLATION true  
```  
 
**3** Login to Azure:

**2.a** Azure Developer CLI:

```sh
azd auth login
```

**2.b** Azure CLI:

```sh
az login
```

**4** Start Building the infrastructure and components deployment:

```sh
azd provision
```

**5** Next, you will use the Virtual Machine with the Bastion connection (created during step 4) to continue the deployment.  
   
Log into the created VM with the user **gptrag** and authenticate with the password stored in the keyvault, similar to the figure below:  

<BR>   
<img src="media/readme-keyvault-login.png" alt="Keyvault Login" width="1024">
   
**6**  Upon accessing Windows, install [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4#installing-the-msi-package), as the other prerequisites are already installed on the VM.  
   
**7** Open the command prompt and run the following command to update azd to the latest version:  
   
```  
choco upgrade azd  
```  
   
After updating azd, simply close and reopen the terminal.  
   
**8** Create a new directory, for example, `deploy` then enter the created directory.  
   
```  
mkdir deploy  
cd deploy  
```  
To finalize the procedure, execute the subsequent commands in the command prompt to successfully complete the deployment:

```  
azd init -t azure/gpt-rag  
azd auth login   
azd env refresh  
azd package  
azd deploy  
```  
   
> Note: when running the ```azd init ...``` and ```azd env refresh```, use the same environment name, subscription, and region used in the initial provisioning of the infrastructure.  
   
**Done! Zero trust deployment is completed.**

**Recommended**: [Add app authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service). [Watch this quick tutorial](https://youtu.be/sA-an25jMB4) for step-by-step guidance.

## How to?

This section provides quick guides for customizing, managing, and troubleshooting your deployment.
