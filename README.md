# GPT-RAG Solution Accelerator

The **RAG pattern** enables businesses to use the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, using their existing models to process and generate responses based on new data. RAG facilitates periodic data updates without the need for fine-tuning, thereby streamlining the integration of LLMs into businesses. 

The **Enterprise RAG** Solution Accelerator (GPT-RAG) offers a robust architecture tailored for enterprise-grade deployment of the RAG pattern. It ensures grounded responses and is built on Zero-trust security and Responsible AI, ensuring availability, scalability, and auditability. Ideal for organizations transitioning from exploration and PoC stages to full-scale production and MVPs.

‚ú® See our [User & Admin Guide](docs/GUIDE.md) for complete setup and usage details.

## Application Components

GPT-RAG follows a modular approach, consisting of three components, each with a specific function.

* **[Data Ingestion](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-ingestion)** - Optimizes data chunking and indexing for the RAG retrieval step.

* **Orchestrator** - Manages information retrieval and response generation. Choose between **[Functional](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-orchestrator)** using Semantic Kernel functions or **[Agentic](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-agentic)** powered by AutoGen. Refer to the deployment instructions to switch.

* **App Front-End** ‚Äì Provides the user interface. Choose between the **[React Front-End](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-frontend)**, the original interface built with React, or the **[Chainlit Front-End](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-ui)**, supporting streaming and easy customization, used exclusively with the agentic orchestrator. Both follow the [Backend for Front-End](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/backends-for-frontends) pattern.


<!-- * [Teams-BOT](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-bot) Constructed using Azure BOT Services, this platform enables users to engage with the Orchestrator seamlessly through the Microsoft Teams interface. -->
