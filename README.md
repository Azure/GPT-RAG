# GPT-RAG Solution Accelerator

This solution accelerator provides architecture templates and deployment assets to help organizations build secure, scalable, and enterprise-ready **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** solutions powered by **AI Agents**. It applies proven Azure design patterns and incorporates **Zero-Trust security**, **Responsible AI**, and **end-to-end observability**, enabling teams to operationalize Generative AI with confidence.

For full documentation, visit the **[GPT-RAG documentation site](https://azure.github.io/GPT-RAG/)**.

GPT-RAG is built on a Zero-Trust architecture to ensure that all components operate within a controlled, isolated environment. Network access is tightly governed, and communication between services follows least-privilege principles.

## AI Agent Capabilities

The accelerator supports a broad range of enterprise scenarios—from customer support to decision automation—by enabling systems to process complex queries across large data collections. It is designed for seamless integration into existing environments and can be adapted to both straightforward and advanced operational patterns.

A key capability of GPT-RAG is its support for **AI Agents**, enabling scenarios such as **NL2SQL query generation** and other context-aware interactions. This extensibility allows organizations to build intelligent workflows that retrieve, interpret, and act on data with contextual precision.
