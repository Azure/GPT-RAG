# GPT-RAG Solution Accelerator

The **RAG pattern** enables businesses to use the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, using their existing models to process and generate responses based on new data. RAG facilitates periodic data updates without the need for fine-tuning, thereby streamlining the integration of LLMs into businesses. 

The **Enterprise RAG** Solution Accelerator (GPT-RAG) offers a robust architecture tailored for enterprise-grade deployment of the RAG pattern. It ensures grounded responses and is built on Zero-trust security and Responsible AI, ensuring availability, scalability, and auditability. Ideal for organizations transitioning from exploration and PoC stages to full-scale production and MVPs.

### Zero Trust Architecture Deployment

For more secure and isolated deployments, you can opt for the Zero Trust architecture. This architecture is ideal for production environments where network isolation and stringent security measures are highly valued.
