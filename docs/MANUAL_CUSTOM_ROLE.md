# Creating a Custom Role for GPT-RAG Installation

This guide provides steps to create a custom role in Azure and assign it to a user for performing the GPT-RAG installation at the subscription level.

> [!TIP]  
> This procedure applies when you prefer creating a custom role with more specific permissions instead of assigning the **Owner** or **Contributor + User Access Administrator** role.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Go to Subscriptions**
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to **Subscriptions**.
   - Select the relevant subscription where the custom role will be assigned.

2. **Access Control (IAM)**
   - Within the selected subscription, click on **Access control (IAM)** in the left-hand menu.

   - Click **+ Add** and then **Add custom role**.
   - Choose **Start from scratch** to create a new role with custom permissions.

4. **Configure Role Details**
   - In the **Custom role name** field, enter a unique name for the role (e.g., `CMFAI-GPTRAG`).
   - In the **Description** field, provide a description for the role's purpose, such as "Custom role for GPT-RAG installation."
