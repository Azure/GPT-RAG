## Installation Procedure

### Before You Begin

**Gather Necessary Information**

- Subscription Name
- Resource Group Name
- Azure Location Location
- Azure Environment Name (ex: gpt-rag-dev,  gpt-rag-poc, ...)

> [!NOTE]
> Choose a region with sufficient service quotas. Commonly tested regions include eastus2, eastus, and westus.

**Review these points for potential customizations**

- **Resource names** (optional)

You can customize the names of the resources being created. By default, azd automatically generates a unique name based on the environment name, subscription, and location. If you prefer to define specific names, refer to [this page](CUSTOMIZATIONS_RESOURCE_NAMES.md) to learn how to customize each resource name. Before running the `azd provisioning` command, you must execute a command like the one below to apply these custom names to each resource you want to customize:

`azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_TYPE_NAME <yourResourceNameHere>`

- **Reuse pre-existing resources** (optional)

In some cases, you may want to use one or more pre-existing resources in your subscription instead of creating new ones. Our Bicep template allows you to do this. For detailed instructions on how this can be achieved, please take a look at the [Bring Your Own Resources](CUSTOMIZATIONS_BYOR.md) page.

- **Virtual Network Configuration** (optional)

Adjust network addressing to avoid overlaps with existing VNets, as overlapping address ranges prevent direct connections via VNet peering, VPN gateways, or ExpressRoute. The default address ranges are:

| **Network Item**         | **Address Range**    |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **AI VNet**              | **10.0.0.0/23**      |
| **ai-subnet**            | **10.0.0.0/26**      |
| **app-services-subnet**  | **10.0.0.192/26**    |
| **database-subnet**      | **10.0.1.0/26**      |
| **app-int-subnet**       | **10.0.0.128/26**    |
| **AzureBastionSubnet**   | **10.0.0.64/26**     |

Each `/26` subnet offers 59 usable IP addresses, as Azure reserves 5 IP addresses in each subnet. The `/23` VNet allows 507 usable IP addresses. To customize address ranges, set the following environment variables:

| **Environment Variable**               | **Network Item**      |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `AZURE_VNET_ADDRESS`                   | AI VNet               |
| `AZURE_AI_SUBNET_PREFIX`               | AI Subnet             |
| `AZURE_APP_INT_SUBNET_PREFIX`          | App Internal Subnet   |
| `AZURE_APP_SERVICES_SUBNET_PREFIX`     | App Services Subnet   |
| `AZURE_BASTION_SUBNET_PREFIX`          | Bastion Subnet        |
| `AZURE_DATABASE_SUBNET_PREFIX`         | Database Subnet       |

Set the desired address range with `azd env` command after `azd int` and before `az provision`. 

Example: `azd env set AZURE_AI_SUBNET_PREFIX 10.0.0.16/26`.

- **DNS Customization** (optional)

The Solution Accelerator will configure default DNS settings using Azure Private DNS Zones to resolve private endpoints within the resource group. This setup ensures seamless name resolution without requiring additional configuration.

However, if your organization has specific DNS requirements or prefers a different DNS setup, you have the flexibility to customize the DNS configurations. These customizations are not included in the automated installation process and will need to be configured separately.

Customization options include creating and managing your own private DNS zones, integrating with on-premises DNS servers, or setting up conditional forwarders to handle name resolution across various network environments. For detailed guidance on these customization strategies, please refer to our comprehensive [Private Endpoint DNS Integration scenarios](https://github.com/dmauser/PrivateLink/tree/master/DNS-Integration-Scenarios).

### Installation Steps

Before starting the Zero Trust architecture deployment, review the prerequisites. Note that Node.js and Python are only required for the second phase, which you will perform on the VM created during the deployment. To deploy this architecture, follow these steps using Azure Developer CLI (azd) in your terminal:

**1** Download the Repository

```sh
azd init -t azure/gpt-rag
```

> **Note**: Add `-b agentic` if using the Agentic AutoGen-based orchestrator.
> ```sh
> azd init -t azure/gpt-rag -b agentic
> ```

**2** Enable network isolation
   
```sh  
azd env set AZURE_NETWORK_ISOLATION true  
```  
 
**2** Login to Azure:

**2.a** Azure Developer CLI:

```sh
azd auth login
```

**2.b** Azure CLI:

```sh
az login
```

**3** Set environment variable values

Run the `azd env set` commands if you want to customize the installation as indicated in the previous section.

**4** Start Building the infrastructure and components deployment:

```sh
azd provision
```

**5** Use the Virtual Machine with the Bastion connection (created in step 4) to proceed with the deployment.
   
Log into the created VM with the user **gptrag** and authenticate with the password stored in the key vault, similar to the figure below:  

<BR>   
<img src="../media/readme-keyvault-login.png" alt="Keyvault Login" width="1024">
   
**6**  Upon accessing Windows, install [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4#installing-the-msi-package), as the other prerequisites are already installed on the VM.  
   
**7** Open the command prompt and run the following command to update azd to the latest version:  
   
```  
choco upgrade azd  
```  
   
After updating azd, simply close and reopen the terminal.  
   
**8** Create a new directory, for example, `deploy` then enter the created directory.  
   
```  
mkdir deploy  
cd deploy  
```  

To finalize the procedure, execute the subsequent commands in the command prompt to successfully complete the deployment:

```  
azd init -t azure/gpt-rag  
azd auth login   
azd env refresh  
azd package  
azd deploy  
```  

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Note: when running the ```azd init ...``` and ```azd env refresh```, use the same environment name, subscription, and region used in the initial provisioning of the infrastructure.  
   
> **Note**: Add `-b agentic` if using the Agentic AutoGen-based orchestrator.
> ```sh
> azd init -t azure/gpt-rag -b agentic
> ```

**Done! Zero trust deployment is completed.**

### Optional Next Steps

**9** [Add app authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/scenario-secure-app-authentication-app-service). [Watch this quick tutorial](https://youtu.be/sA-an25jMB4) for step-by-step guidance.

**10** Configure [Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/create-front-door-portal) to allow external access to your app only through Azure Front Door.

**11. Configure Outbound Rules for External Services**

The solution accelerator allows integration with other services to enhance the data sources used for grounding the solution. If you plan to connect to these external services as described in the [AI Integration HUB](AI_INTEGRATION_HUB.md) section, you'll need to configure outbound rules for specific public endpoints, as shown in the table below.


| Service                | Source                       | Destination                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Bing Custom Search      | Orchestrator Function App    | https://api.bing.microsoft.com        |
| MS Graph API            | Data Ingestion Function App  | https://graph.microsoft.com      |

> [!TIP]
> Use **Azure API Management** to secure API requests when connecting to external services.

### Extending Application Components

After installing the solution accelerator, you may want to customize its application components. For example, you can modify the orchestrator for a specific scenario or adjust the data ingestion app for different chunk generation. See [Extending App Components](EXTENDING_APP_COMPONENTS.md) for details.
