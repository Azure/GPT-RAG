This page covers common issues, debugging tools, and how to inspect logs in GPT-RAG.


**Showing Response Time Statistics in the Chat UI**

The GPT-RAG UI includes a built-in option to display response time after each agent answer. To enable it, set the `SHOW_STATISTICS` application setting to `true` in your Container App (or App Configuration). Once enabled, each response in the chat will show timing information, helping you identify slow responses and compare performance across different queries or configurations.


**Enabling Debug Logging**

To increase log verbosity for any GPT-RAG component (orchestrator, ingestion, or UI), set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `DEBUG` in the corresponding Container App. For example, in the Azure Portal go to your Container App → Environment variables → set `LOG_LEVEL` = `DEBUG`. After restarting the container, the application will emit detailed logs including internal function calls, SDK diagnostics, and step-by-step execution traces. Remember to revert to `INFO` or `WARNING` after troubleshooting to avoid excessive log volume and cost.


**Viewing Logs in Application Insights**

All GPT-RAG components send telemetry to Application Insights. Open your Application Insights resource in the Azure Portal and go to **Logs** to run KQL queries.

To find recent errors across all components:

```kql
traces
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| where severityLevel >= 3
| project timestamp, message, cloud_RoleName, severityLevel
| order by timestamp desc
| take 50
```

To see errors specifically in the orchestrator:

```kql
traces
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| where cloud_RoleName contains "orchestrator"
| where severityLevel >= 3
| project timestamp, message, operation_Id
| order by timestamp desc
```

To trace a single request end-to-end using its operation ID (you can get this from a previous query or from the UI response headers):

```kql
traces
| where operation_Id == "YOUR_OPERATION_ID"
| order by timestamp asc
| project timestamp, message, severityLevel, cloud_RoleName
```

To check for rate-limit (429) or throttling issues in ingestion:

```kql
traces
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| where cloud_RoleName contains "ingest"
| where message contains "429" or message contains "throttl" or message contains "rate limit"
| project timestamp, message
| order by timestamp desc
```

To view exceptions with stack traces:

```kql
exceptions
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| project timestamp, problemId, outerMessage, details, cloud_RoleName
| order by timestamp desc
| take 20
```


**Deploy fails after switching azd environments (stale `APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT`)**

If `azd deploy <component>` fails right after starting with an Azure CLI error saying the App Configuration resource does not exist or cannot be found, and the message references an `https://<name>.azconfig.io` endpoint that does not match your current environment, the most likely cause is a stale `APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT` environment variable left over from a previous deployment.

The component deploy scripts (`scripts/deploy.ps1` and `scripts/deploy.sh`) prefer the value of `APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT` from your shell over the value stored in the active `azd` environment. When the previous App Configuration was deleted or recreated (for example, after tearing down an azd env and provisioning a new one), the stale value silently wins and the deploy targets a resource that no longer exists.

Clear the variable from your shell and let `azd env` provide the correct value:

PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item env:APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
azd env get-values | Out-Null  # optional, confirms the active env
azd deploy <component>
```

Bash:

```bash
unset APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT
azd env get-values >/dev/null  # optional
azd deploy <component>
```

To avoid this in the future:

- Open a fresh terminal when switching between azd environments.
- If you must set `APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT` manually (for example, on a jumpbox or in CI), confirm it matches `azd env get-value APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT` before deploying.

The component deploy scripts also print a yellow warning when the shell `APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT` and the active azd env disagree, starting with GPT-RAG [v2.9.1](https://github.com/Azure/GPT-RAG/releases/tag/v2.9.1) (orchestrator v2.8.3, ingestion v2.4.4, ui v2.3.11). See [#491](https://github.com/Azure/GPT-RAG/issues/491) for context.


**Known Issues and Fixes**

Below is a list of commonly reported issues that have been resolved. If you encounter one of these, make sure you are running the version that includes the fix.

**OOM container restarts during parallel ingestion** — Ingestion containers could run out of memory when processing multiple large files concurrently. Fixed by adding memory guards, temp-file downloads for large PDFs, and lowering default concurrency. See [#438](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag/issues/438).

**Re-indexing caused by embedding retry issues** — Transient embedding failures could cause documents to be unnecessarily re-indexed. Fixed in ingestion v2.2.5. See [#437](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag/issues/437).

**All documents re-indexed when permissionFilterOption is enabled** — Enabling document-level security caused a full re-index instead of incremental updates. Fixed in ingestion v2.2.5. See [#436](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag/issues/436).
