This page covers common issues, debugging tools, and how to inspect logs in GPT-RAG.

!!! warning "Unmerged P2 upload and download corrections"
    UI [`f2ac90c`](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-ui/commit/f2ac90cc7c236cc3e677f147bcc107367f2fd821)
    adds uploaded filenames to session bookkeeping only after confirmed batch
    ingestion. A false result or exception preserves previously confirmed names;
    the boolean client contract cannot confirm individual files in a partial
    batch. **A nonempty question still continues after failed attachments.**
    Whether to stop that question remains the pending H6 decision, not approval
    of the current continuation. Do not treat an answer as confirmation that
    the new attachments were ingested.

    Standalone download failures now use fixed generic text: typed
    `ResourceNotFoundError` returns 404; other failures return 500 even if their
    message contains `BlobNotFound`. Dependency details and file paths are
    omitted from this failure diagnostic. This does not change Copilot access.
    The secure grant route's existing generic 500/no-store catch covers only
    synchronous downloader acquisition, after authorization checks. Conversation
    resolution and late stream iteration are outside that catch; the P2 scope
    clarification adds no runtime handler or transport-termination guarantee.
    These are unmerged notes for
    [#110](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-ui/pull/110), not released guarantees.


**Showing Response Time Statistics in the Chat UI**

The GPT-RAG UI includes a built-in option to display response time after each agent answer. To enable it, set the `SHOW_STATISTICS` application setting to `true` in your Container App (or App Configuration). Once enabled, each response in the chat will show timing information, helping you identify slow responses and compare performance across different queries or configurations.


**Enabling Debug Logging**

To increase log verbosity for any GPT-RAG component (orchestrator, ingestion, or UI), set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `DEBUG` in the corresponding Container App. For example, in the Azure Portal go to your Container App → Environment variables → set `LOG_LEVEL` = `DEBUG`. After restarting the container, the application will emit detailed logs including internal function calls, SDK diagnostics, and step-by-step execution traces. Remember to revert to `INFO` or `WARNING` after troubleshooting to avoid excessive log volume and cost.


**Viewing Logs in Application Insights**

All GPT-RAG components send telemetry to Application Insights. Open your Application Insights resource in the Azure Portal and go to **Logs** to run KQL queries.

To find recent errors across all components:

```kql
traces
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| where severityLevel >= 3
| project timestamp, message, cloud_RoleName, severityLevel
| order by timestamp desc
| take 50
```

To see errors specifically in the orchestrator:

```kql
traces
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| where cloud_RoleName contains "orchestrator"
| where severityLevel >= 3
| project timestamp, message, operation_Id
| order by timestamp desc
```

To trace a single request end-to-end using its operation ID (you can get this from a previous query or from the UI response headers):

```kql
traces
| where operation_Id == "YOUR_OPERATION_ID"
| order by timestamp asc
| project timestamp, message, severityLevel, cloud_RoleName
```

To check for rate-limit (429) or throttling issues in ingestion:

```kql
traces
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| where cloud_RoleName contains "ingest"
| where message contains "429" or message contains "throttl" or message contains "rate limit"
| project timestamp, message
| order by timestamp desc
```

To view exceptions with stack traces:

```kql
exceptions
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| project timestamp, problemId, outerMessage, details, cloud_RoleName
| order by timestamp desc
| take 20
```


**Deploy fails after switching azd environments (stale `APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT`)**

If `azd deploy <component>` fails right after starting with an Azure CLI error saying the App Configuration resource does not exist or cannot be found, and the message references an `https://<name>.azconfig.io` endpoint that does not match your current environment, the most likely cause is a stale `APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT` environment variable left over from a previous deployment.

The component deploy scripts (`scripts/deploy.ps1` and `scripts/deploy.sh`) prefer the value of `APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT` from your shell over the value stored in the active `azd` environment. When the previous App Configuration was deleted or recreated (for example, after tearing down an azd env and provisioning a new one), the stale value silently wins and the deploy targets a resource that no longer exists.

Clear the variable from your shell and let `azd env` provide the correct value:

PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item env:APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
azd env get-values | Out-Null  # optional, confirms the active env
azd deploy <component>
```

Bash:

```bash
unset APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT
azd env get-values >/dev/null  # optional
azd deploy <component>
```

To avoid this in the future:

- Open a fresh terminal when switching between azd environments.
- If you must set `APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT` manually (for example, on a jumpbox or in CI), confirm it matches `azd env get-value APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT` before deploying.

The component deploy scripts also print a yellow warning when the shell `APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT` and the active azd env disagree, starting with GPT-RAG [v2.9.1](https://github.com/Azure/GPT-RAG/releases/tag/v2.9.1) (orchestrator v2.8.3, ingestion v2.4.4, ui v2.3.11). See [#491](https://github.com/Azure/GPT-RAG/issues/491) for context.


**Known Issues and Fixes**

Below is a list of commonly reported issues that have been resolved. If you encounter one of these, make sure you are running the version that includes the fix.

**OOM container restarts during parallel ingestion** — Ingestion containers could run out of memory when processing multiple large files concurrently. Fixed by adding memory guards, temp-file downloads for large PDFs, and lowering default concurrency. See [#438](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag/issues/438).

**Re-indexing caused by embedding retry issues** — Transient embedding failures could cause documents to be unnecessarily re-indexed. Fixed in ingestion v2.2.5. See [#437](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag/issues/437).

**All documents re-indexed when permissionFilterOption is enabled** — Enabling document-level security caused a full re-index instead of incremental updates. Fixed in ingestion v2.2.5. See [#436](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag/issues/436).
