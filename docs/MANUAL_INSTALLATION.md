# Manual Installation for Zero Trust

This guide details the manual installation of the Solution Accelerator within a Zero Trust architecture. It includes prerequisites, a comprehensive list of required resources, and a step-by-step installation process.

If you prefer to proceed with the automated installation, please follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](https://github.com/Azure/GPT-RAG#zero-trust-architecture-deployment) section. However, feel free to read this document to understand the process behind the scenes.

## Prerequisites

* [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* [Access to Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access) - submit a form to request access.
* [Azure CLI (az)](https://aka.ms/install-az) - to run azure cli commands.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - to get repository contents.

You will also need the following permissions:
* Role: Owner or Contributor + User Access Administrator
* Scope: Resource group or Subscription

Alternatively, you can create a [**Custom Role**](MANUAL_CUSTOM_ROLE.md).

12. **Application Settings**
    - The applications (orchestrator, data ingestion, and frontend web app) use information obtained from environment variables. These variables are stored as App Settings in each application. When using the automated procedure, you don't need to worry about this. However, for the manual procedure, you'll need to set these variables manually. 
    - [Click here to see an example](MANUAL_ENVIRONMENT.md) of how to set these variables using the Azure CLI. You will need to adjust the commands to correctly reflect the names of your applications and parameters.

13. **Application Deployment**

    - Once resources are provisioned and settings configured, you’re ready to deploy each application.
    - First clone the repositories for each application.
    - For the Orchestrator Function App and Data Ingestion Function App:
      - In VSCode with the [Azure Function App Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions), go to the *Azure* panel, locate your Function App in the resource explorer, right-click on it, and select *Deploy*.
    - For the App Service Frontend deployment refer to the deployment section in the [frontend repo](https://github.com/Azure/gpt-rag-frontend#deploy-quickstart).

14. **External Access**
    - To allow internet access to your app, permit access only from [Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/create-front-door-portal) to your App Service.
